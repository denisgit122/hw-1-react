<h4 class="h4_1">Biography</h4>
<p>Bartholomew "Bart" Jojo Simpson (born April 1[7] or
    February 23[8]) is the mischievous, rebellious, misunderstood, disruptive and
    "potentially dangerous" oldest child of the Simpson family in The Simpsons. He
    is the only son of Homer and Marge Simpson, and the older brother of Lisa and Maggie.
    He also has been nicknamed "Cosmo", after discovering a comet in "Bart's Comet". Bart
    has also been on the cover on numerous comics, such as "Critical Hit", "Simpsons
    Treasure Trove #11", and "Winter Wingding". Bart also has a 100-issue comic series
    entitled the Simpson Comics Presents Bart Simpson. Bart is loosely based on Matt
    Groening and his older brother, Mark Groening.</p>
<p>Even at a young age, Bart has accomplished many feats. He has won an award for his Angr
    y Dad web series[9], he has discovered a new comet which was named after him[10], and
    he also has performed in a successful band with Milhouse Van Houten, Nelson Muntz, and
    Ralph Wiggum.[11]</p>
