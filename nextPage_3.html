<h4 class="h4_1">Biography</h4>
<p>Homer Jay Simpson (born May 12, 1956 or 1969 or 1977 or 1983)
    [40] is the main protagonist of The Simpsons series (or show).
    He is the spouse of Marge Simpson and father of Bart, Lisa and
    Maggie Simpson. Homer is overweight (said to be ~240 pounds),
    lazy, and often ignorant to the world around him. Although Homer
    has many flaws, he has shown to have great caring, love, and even
    bravery to those he cares about and, sometimes, even others he
    doesn't. He also serves as the main protagonist of the The Simpsons
    Movie. Homer Simpson is 39 years old.</p>
<p>His favorite color is blue, and he enjoys dancing, eating donuts, drinking,
    hugging, driving a sit-down arcade racer, playing the piano and horse riding.
    His favorite kiddie rides are "Stuart Little", "Barney Train" and "Ride the
    Champion Mechanical Horse".</p>
<p>Homer works as a low-level safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear
    Power Plant in Sector 7G, although he is often incompetent and
    negligent towards his duties. He spends a great deal of his time
    at Moe's Tavern with his friends Barney Gumble, Carl Carlson, Lenny
    Leonard, and Moe Szyslak. At home, he can often be found sitting on
    the couch mindlessly watching TV while snacking on food and
    drinking Duff. Homer is also the only son of Abraham Simpson
    II and Mona Simpson. When provoked, he often strangles Bart for
    pressuring him. Even though he mutually hates his wife's sisters
    Patty and Selma Bouvier, he played Selma's husband for her to adopt
    Ling and agreed to be the minister for Patty's intended homosexual
    marriage. As a result of this, Homer is her legal adoptive father.
    [41]</p>
<p>Homer is named after Matt Groening's late father Homer Groening.
    In a series of interviews in 1990, Groening reportedly stated
    that he named the character after the Homer Simpson in The Day
    of the Locust, a 1939 novel by Nathanael West according to Planet
    Simpson, but neither explanation is considered definitive.</p>
